Hello and welcome to Cadence, my personal blog. To learn more about me, head to [brianpho.com](https://brianpho.com). Otherwise, this blog is where I post random thoughts and ideas that I have. 

The name of this site, Cadence, comes from a song that I really like: [3LAU - Would You Understand (feat. Carly Paige)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DzJDoVcCpU). Cadence means "[the rhythm of sounds](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cadence)" and I chose it because it's similar to how these thoughts keep reoccurring in my mind.

I realized that I needed some outlet for all of these ideas running around in my head and Cadence is my response. I hope you enjoy reading the posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

Thank you.
