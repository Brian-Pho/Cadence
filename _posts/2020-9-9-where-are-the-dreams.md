title: "Where Are the Dreams?"
excerpt: "Me expressing my sadness in people's lack of ambitious goals and hopes."
---

I consider myself an ambitious person compared to most people I've met. I want to build artificial general intelligence and I don't just say that I want to. I've create an entire website ([CR4-DL](https://brianpho.com/CR4-DL/)) for posting my brain and AI notes and I'm currently pursuing a masters in neuroscience to formalize my science training. I'm not a dog that just barks, I also bite. However, I wasn't always like this as it was only recently (past four years) that I've devoted myself to a big goal. Before reading *Mastery* by Robert Greene and this [AI post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) on WaitButWhy, I was like most people in that I was wandering aimlessly and just wanted to live a normal life. A life of working nine to five, making enough money to buy the material possessions that I desired in the moment, and watching TV until bed. Heck, I still do some of these things from time-to-time but now my time is focused. I feel bad if I'm not working towards AI by reading or being creative.

However, this post isn't about my ambitions but rather my feelings towards the general lack of ambition and hope that I see in people I've met. I'm not talking about general goals such as the desire to go to medical school or to start a business (startups are hot these days). I'm talking about the lack of hopes and dreams to push humanity forward. I'm talking about aiming to solve grand problems such the Grand Unified Theory in physics, colonizing the solar system, or creating a revolutionary solution to climate change. I don't expect people to solve such big problems, just like how I don't expect myself to create AI, but I do wish that people would talk as if they would. And to not only talk, but to also choose actions that back up that desire.

I think the problem stems from a focus on the present. Focusing on the present is easy because it's convenient and because people are lazy; it's literally present. However, focusing on the present means that's you've given up control; to become an actor in a play. The script is written for you and you just have to act it out. And while I have nothing against such people, I do wish humanity would aim for higher heights. We didn't get to the present by thinking about the present, we got the present by imagining the unknown, unbuilt, and unseen. We should remember that computers, smartphones, lightbulbs, cars, airplanes, books, and money didn't grow off a tree, they were invented in the minds of people before being actualized in reality.

I think this is why I enjoy sci-fi so much, it imagines the unimaginable. It's future thinking and detached from reality but that's what we need. To make reality better than it is, we have to imagine that it could be better and work towards it. My favourite sci-fi series, *The Three Body Problem*, deals with humanity's first contact with aliens and how humanity rises to the occasion to survive and fend off an extinction-level crisis. Another book, *The Wandering Earth*, written by the same author, deals with similar large problems to humanity such as pushing the Earth out of the solar system or building the first spaceship. Real-life examples include the Apollo era where humanity went to the moon and Elon Musk and his vision of humanity as a space-fairing civilization.

Overall, I wish people would set big goals for themselves not to achieve such big goals, but to push themselves to achieve their potential and to focus their time. The future of humanity depends on solving ambitious problems and to create a better world for ourselves. To be half awake and half asleep, to dream.
